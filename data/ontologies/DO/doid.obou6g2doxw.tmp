comment: NAFL was not addressed in the 2023 international update that revised the nomenclature and definition of NAFLD/MASLD and NASH/MASH. Generally considered a subtype of NAFLD, it is unclear if NAFL should continue to be considered a distinct disease in clinical practice. Use care when annotating data to this disease. It may be deprecated and merged into MASLD in the future (2023-11-29, JAB).
